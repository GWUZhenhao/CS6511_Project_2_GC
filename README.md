# CS6511_Project_2_GC
Graph coloring algorithm by Zhenhao Zhao.

My GWID end with an odd, so my project is graph coloring. The project 2 contained 4 files:<br>
  `Data.txt`: Store the input data. Change this file to change the input.<br>
  `GC.py`: Main python script to run the algorithm. (Running the program here!)<br>
  `GC_utils.py`: All the classes and functions to support GC.py for the constraint searching algorithm.<br>
  `unit_test_GC_utils.py`: Unit test file for this project.<br>
